       <p> 
        My name is Nicole Deshong and I'm from Maui, Hawaii. I was a former teacher assistant for La Petite Academy where I ensured the daily care of every child by following all licensing guidelines, created a fun and interactive learning experiences, as well as communicated directly with parents about their childâ€™s overall development and success. Working with children for the past five years has taught me how to think quickly on my feet as well as having patience no matter the circumstance. I also have a background in community work which ranges from working with non-profits, foodbanks, to fundraising for youth leadership events.

        <br> Outside of work, some of my favorite activities include hiking, spending the day at the beach, and hitting the gym. In addition, I enjoy spending quality time with friends and family. I moved to Washington state about a year ago to pursue a career in software development, following in the footsteps of my mother. I'm looking forward to feeling a sense of purpose in my career and maximizing my full potential.
        
        <br> Through my experiences, I've learned that the status quo cannot be broken through innovation and team-building exercises alone, but by framing the workplace in such a the way that obstacles become the motivating factor, and not the reason for failure.
